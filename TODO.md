# TODO
* HUFFMAN.md
  * Some section on the overall format, just for the sake of completeness
* huffman_encoder implementation
  * Huffman encoder tests:
    * Maybe abandon comparing against CUE altogether: there is little value in doing so
      * Compare against decoder only. But maybe also test expected size
      * And improve some tests:
        * Like have 1 symbol, 1 time, but also 1 symbol, 32 times, 33 times
  * echo -n ABBCCDDEEEE>foo
    * When encoded with CUE huffman, this seems to create
      an odd tree which contains 'A' twice.
      * I may have hallucinated this, but maybe investigate
      * Why is that?
        * But the code for both instances of 'A' is the same?
      * What does our tree generation/serializaton code?
  * Next:
    * Tree serialization
      * Here we should have a couple of sanity checks:
        * Maximum tree size
        * Maximum child node offset
        * Do not forget sanity checks, e.g. those max. offsets
        * Question: assert or exception?
          * Probably exception: we're rather unsure how to do it correctly,
            so for starters we probably want it also in release builds.
    * Do not forget: for encoder testing we cannot use CUE input!
      * We should mark all files generated with CUE as such!
      * Or well at least we should it note down somewhere
* There is a test for the RLE decoder which tests decoding through a file stream
  * This is confusing, and what we really want is probably such a test for each encoder/decoder
    * Just because it works with the RLE decoder doesn't automatically mean it works with all other decoders/encoders, no?
* Encoders:
  * These use all byte_reader to read input data.
  * This is not wrong, but byte_reader.read8() throws decode_exception if eof is reached
  * That's fine, since the encoders are written such that this cannot happen
  * Still, it's conceptually ugly/wrong. Need to do something about this (?)
* Overflow with files > 4GB
  * Affects byte_reader/byte_writer/unbounded_byte_writer
  * These have m_nbytes_read and m_nbytes_written variables, which are 32 bit
  * If we attempt to process a file > 4GB, then things will go wrong
* github workflow
  * Somehow install Catch2 so that it does not need to be built
    * On Ubuntu, use apt
    * But what about windows?
  * Get gcc build running => Works, but need a more recent g++ on github (14.2 seems to work locally)
  * Enable fail-fast (in the yml file)
* This is somewhat unexpected:
  * A test (huffman-bitstream-alignment) indicates that the GBA BIOS does not decode data correctly
    when the uncompressed data is an odd number of bytes (not sure whether it needs to be a multiple of 2 or 4)
    * Well since the BIOS seems to be able to decode to VRAM it's to be expected that it needs some sort of alignment/padding
    * Instead of guessing around we might simply want to disassemble the damn thing.
* Maybe, just to be sure:
  * Can we prove/disprove that the bitstream needs to be aligned?
    * We would have to somehow construct an image where the huffman tree contains padding at the end
    * We would then have to somehow remove that padding and fix up the tree size field
      * A decoder that does not check bitstream alignment should then still be able to decode
      * A decoder that does check bitstream alignment should bark
      * And the ultimate interesting thing: what does a real GBA BIOS on a real GBA do?
* Maybe we should document our insights on huffman a bit
  * Copy documentation from GBATEK.txt
  * Annotate it
    * Tree size/offset (It's an offset, respectively at the end of the tree are padding bytes to align the bitstream)
    * Alignment of bitstream (see above)
    * Encoding types (personal tests with real BIOS on emulators have shown that 1 and 2 bit is not supported, so other more exotic encodings probably aren't, either)
* Use uint8_t or std::uint8_t?
  * Same for other <cstdint> types
* vtgcore: should probably start using VtgEnableWarnings.cmake, since this is best we have atm
* THEN
  * Enable warnings for g++ and clang
    * See what warnings doctest has enabled for g++, see whether these make sense? (see snippet below)
    * see what other warnings we have noted in vtgcore's TODO.md?
      * Raise warning level in gcc/clang: add -Wconversion?
* See what other ideas from the cmake book we'd like to put into place (note: this should be run on github action!)
  * valgrind
  * code coverage for unit tests
  * clang-fmt
  * clang-tidy
  * Add reuse custom target to CMakeLists.txt?
  * Cmake Built-in static analyzers, e.g. "include only what you need". Anything else?
* Checklist for a new code base
  * Automate the build => That is, have a top level shell script that runs stuff
    * configure
    * build
    * run tests
    * reuse lint
  * Turn on all error messages, treat warnings as errors
  * Set up reuse to check licensing stuff
* Toplevel makefile:
  * Do we want to disable unit tests by default if not the main project?
  * Do we want to have an option to enable/disable unit tests explicitly?
