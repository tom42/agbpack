# TODO
* Next: we have a library with an empty module.
  * Add a bogus function to the module
  * Write a unit test that calls that function and verifies its result
* add_subdirectory(src bin)? Why would we want to do that?
* Enable warnings (which ones? Those from vtgcore, or maybe we have a look at doctest?)
